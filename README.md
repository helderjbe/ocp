# Optical communication protocol

This program was written for the implementation phase of the dissertation "Integration of optical communications in an underwater docking station."
The paper can be seen [here](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/111139/2/257403.pdf).

- master.py and slave.py implement the functions to run the protocol.
- sim_*.py implement simulations with the aid of MatPlotLib.
- error_map.py and error_map_slave.py are the lists of possible locations and respective probabilities of error for the AUV.
